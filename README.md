# Draw_a_Shape

This is a basic C++ program which allows the user to input the width and height of a rectangle that they want to create using any symbol that they may like on their keyboard. This program is another example of using nested for loops. 

The second piece of code allows the user to draw two triangles, both reflections of each other by inputting the length and the symbol which they want to use.
